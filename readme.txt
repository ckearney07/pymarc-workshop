Instructions:

Download this directory onto a place you can easily access on your command line (e.g., Documents).  
Unzip it.
Open your command line interface and navigate to the place you downloaded the directory, e.g.:
--cd Documents (cd stands for "change directory)
--Other useful commands to know:
  --pwd (outputs your current location on the server)
  --ls (lists the contents of a directory)
To run the first python script, type into the command line:
--python3 oclc1

You should see the following output:
ocn318875078-01cals_network
ocn668941926-01cals_network
ocm59231572-01cals_network
ocn174040370-01cals_network
ocm52381684-01cals_network
ocn701325822-01cals_network

To run the second script, type into the command line:
--python3 oclc2

You should see the following output:
318875078
668941926
ocm59231572
174040370
ocm52381684
701325822

Homework - how can you adjust the script to get rid of the ocm prefix in two of the items?
Next steps: regular expressions: how could you get rid of any non-numerals?
Output to a file (e.g. CSV)
